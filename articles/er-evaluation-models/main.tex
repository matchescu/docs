        This paper examines entity resolution, the process of identifying if two
        information represent the same real-world entity.
        Despite well-established theoretical models in this field, challenges
        persist in selecting appropriate entity resolution tasks for specific
        contexts.
        These models are associated with quality metrics that assess the
        outcomes of entity resolution tasks.
        Our study demonstrates the possibility of identifying abstract
        conditions invariant to specific solutions and data sets, which instead
        relate to the theoretical model used for evaluating entity resolution
        outcomes.
        This approach offers a novel perspective for understanding the
        performance of entity resolution tasks.

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
    Entity resolution is the task of determining whether multiple information
    refer to the same real-world item or not.
    More restrictive definitions place entity resolution as the task of
    identifying and linking representations of data from two or more
    sources~\cite{Qia17}.
    We share the opinion that identifying and linking data constitutes a more
    specialized process~\cite{Tal11}.
    It is broadly known that entity resolution goes by many names: data
    deduplication, merge-purge, named entity recognition and disambiguation,
    entity alignment, entity matching, and so on.
    Our paper uses a broader, deliberately vague definition that hopes to
    encompass all of the above variants of entity resolution.
    
    Entity resolution solutions have been classified according to many criteria.
    The number of sources or the technical implementation choice are two example
    classification criteria.
    In this paper we examine another way of differentiating between entity
    resolution solutions.
    While it's undeniably interesting to compare entity resolution solutions
    which use deep learning with ones using simple rule-based algorithms, the
    models that underlie the implementations appeal to us more.
    In general, models describe something using the available theoretical tools
    (usually mathematical in nature).
    If we accept the previous statement, it's reasonable to say that multiple
    models describing the same thing provide us with different perspectives over
    the described artifact.
    In our opinion, good models are generic, allowing for the existence of
    varied practical manifestations of their described artifact.
    
    The most widely adopted entity resolution models today describe entity
    resolution in one of two broad ways: as a matching task or as a clustering
    process.
    It is our hope to derive key insights that don't depend on the data, the
    purpose or implementation details of the entity resolution solution, relying
    instead on the entity resolution models themselves.
    In other words, the mere way we describe entity resolution (as matching or
    clustering) should point us toward the insights.
    We will refer to these key insights as \textbf{invariants} for the remainder
    of this paper.
    
    When viewed as a matching problem, entity resolution is closely related to
    information retrieval.
    Perhaps hinting at the validity of the matching perspective, in practice,
    entity resolution is performed most conveniently when using competent
    information retrieval systems such as search engines or vector databases.
    The matching family of models does a good job describing data deduplication
    or record linkage.
    On the other hand, we can see entity resolution as a task that clusters data
    referencing the same real world entity.
    Using this lens, entity resolution becomes interesting for more abstract
    problems such as knowledge management, computer vision or named entity
    recognition and disambiguation.
    Unfortunately, aligning the terminology for matching and clustering models
    for entity resolution is done scarcely in
    literature~\cite{jedai2017,Ben2009Swoosh} and focusing on other objectives
    than ours.
    
    Finding generic entity resolution terminology would allow us to pinpoint
    the particularities of each entity resolution model more easily and more
    clearly. 
    It should also allow us to point out how the model influences the evaluation
    of an implementation by doing away with abstract concepts that are not
    directly relevant in practice.
    For example, the data structures behind the entity resolution output (often
    referred to as entity profiles~\cite{jedai2017}) necessarily differ between
    matching and clustering.
    
    To highlight the process of deriving the invariants from entity resolution
    models, we intend to showcase the calibration of a specific entity
    resolution solution.
    During the calibration process we will look at entity resolution through
    the perspectives conferred to us by two models: an entity matching model and
    a clustering model.
    If invariants exist, they must be lurking in the insights provided by the
    two models.
    The entity resolution solution will be calibrated using a small control
    dataset and we will then verify our findings on well known benchmark data
    two orders of magnitude larger than the control.
    The story of distilling the invariants by inspecting the insights derived
    from the two entity resolution models is a deduction: it is both the
    inspiration for this paper's title and its primary narrative.
    
    A secondary, yet important task helps us reach our main goal.
    Linking entity resolution quality metrics to model families (matching or
    clustering) allows us to reason about the influence of models on the
    pragmatic usage of entity resolution solutions.
    The data structures used in entity matching necessarily differ from the ones
    used in a clustering context.
    This observation provides the basic building blocks to achieve our secondary
    goal.
    Linking metrics to models also allows us to recognize the model we should
    use to deepen our understanding of a particular application of entity
    resolution.
    Finally, associating models with the abstract data types which back entity
    profiles allows us to seamlessly shift our perspective from one model to
    another for the same data and entity resolution solution.
    
    We follow this introduction with a preliminary description focused on
    clarifying the goals and research questions of this paper.
    After briefly summarizing the work that relates to our paper, we introduce
    our own terminology that we use throughout the remaining sections.
    Having finally revisited our two chosen models for entity resolution, we
    delve into some findings from experiments made using a particular rule-based
    entity resolution algorithm.
    The chosen algorithm is merely an example. It may be replaced with any other
    as we take aim at what we may learn from the underlying entity resolution
    models, not from a particular application of those models.

    \section{Related Work}\label{sec:Related Work}
    
    The topic addressed in this paper intersects with a significant body of
    existing research.
    Specifically, it aligns closely with three primary categories: presentations
    of entity resolution systems, theoretical model syntheses for entity
    resolution, and analyses of evaluation metrics in the field of entity
    resolution.

    Papers introducing entity resolution systems are relevant to this study due
    to their common objective of standardizing entity resolution tasks and their
    evaluation methods.
    The majority of the referenced systems in this context offer several generic
    metrics for assessing entity resolution performance.

    At the dawn of the 21st century AD, FEBRL~\cite{febrl2002} emerged as one of
    the first extensible systems to tackle measuring entity resolution
    performance.
    It was succeeded by FEVER~\cite{fever2009} and OYSTER~\cite{oyster2012}.
    These systems have all paved the way to generalizing our understanding about
    entity resolution and to ever more improvements in the quality of entity
    resolution tasks.
    Later on, systems like `Papers with Code'~\cite{papwithcode2019} brought in
    a social dimension to how we compare the qualitative performance of entity
    resolution tasks.
    The systems that came after, such as JedAI~\cite{jedai2017} or Magellan
    \cite{magellan2020} resemble frameworks more than they do
    applications.
    Almost all systems are open-source and encourage social collaboration around
    entity resolution, too.
    
    Next, the syntheses on the theoretical models for entity
    resolution~\cite{fs1969,Ben2009Swoosh,Tal11} are invaluable resources.
    The models we present in this paper have been heavily documented
    elsewhere~\cite{Tal11,tal2013}.    
    We overview the models here to fill potential gaps in the reading flow of
    the paper more than to address another need.
    
    Taking a different tack on describing entity resolution in a generic,
    abstract way, there are studies that shine a procedural light over entity
    resolution~\cite{Pap19,Chen09}.
    These studies showcase the steps of the entity resolution process and the
    significance, challenges and benefits of each step.
    These studies show us that matching and clustering (additionally to being
    aspects of entity resolution) are steps in the entity resolution process.

    Lastly, we note syntheses that present numerous entity resolution metrics
    and their application~\cite{hitesh2012,graf2021frost,barnes2015practioner}.
    The current paper is very similar to these syntheses because it, too
    enumerates metrics and it, too attempts to use those metrics to gather
    deeper insights that would alleviate the burden of adopting entity
    resolution.
    We use this work to find the strongest associations of certain metrics with
    an entity resolution model.
    However, our approach is to discern between theoretical models and attempt
    to extract invariant conditions rooted in the model instead of simply using
    the metrics to evaluate the entity resolution result.

    \subsection{Entity Resolution Models}\label{subsec:Entity Resolution Models}

    There are multiple entity resolution models and they range from ones based
    on complex networks and graph theory\cite{Li2020} to ones based on
    probabilities\cite{fs1969} or algebra\cite{Tal11,Ben2009Swoosh}.
    Broadly speaking, entity resolution models make up two large families:
    \textit{matching} and \textit{clustering} models.
    We are interested in the interplay between two models, one from each family.

    John R. Talburt provides an overview of entity resolution models in his book
    ``Entity Resolution and Information Quality''\cite{Tal11}.
    The main models presented there are the Fellegi-Sunter~\cite{fs1969} model,
    the Stanford Entity Resolution Framework~\cite{Ben2009Swoosh} model and the
    algebraic\cite{tal2007algebraic} model.
    Even though multiple entity matching models were published over time, the
    Fellegi-Sunter model still serves as the archetype for entity matching.
    The algebraic entity resolution model is the easiest to work with from the
    family of clustering models.

    The Fellegi-Sunter model is the main entity matching model.
    Although other significant entity matching models were developed in the
    meantime (from rule-based ones to deep learning enabled ones) entity
    resolution quality evaluation is still largely founded in the probabilistic
    approach described in the Fellegi-Sunter model.
    When measuring results using these metrics, a common experience is not being
    able to fully explain how the quality of the results output by a particular
    entity resolution process varies with the data sets the process operates on.
    A common attitude towards this phenomenon is to chalk it up to the
    characteristics of the underlying data and the size of the dataset.
    
    The second model we look into is the elegant algebraic model.
    The metrics most strongly associated with this model should be very familiar
    to all clustering afficionados.
    Other clustering models, including a particular projection of the more
    generic Stanford Entity Resolution Framework model, can use the same
    metrics.
    Clustering models describe entity resolution at a deeper level than matching
    models if only due to them capturing all four steps of the entity resolution
    process.

    Additionally to presenting the two models we want to answer whether they can
    be used in conjunction to analyse the same result.
    An observer may switch from a matching perspective to a more comprehensive
    one that leverages the clustering aspect of entity resolution.

    \section{Conclusions}\label{sec:Conclusions}

    Entity resolution is a complex task that still holds many unknowns.
    When evaluating entity resolution results in practice it often happens that
    the results on control data sets are not the same as the results obtained
    on `real-world' data.
    
    We set out on a journey to find out whether entity resolution models might
    provide additional insights (that we call invariants) to be used in our
    qualitative assessment of entity resolution implementations.
    Our opinion is that entity resolution models are simply theoretical
    perspectives over the practical act of determining whether entity references
    refer to the same real-world entity.
    We surmised that introducing a common terminology applicable to both
    matching and clustering model families would be beneficial.
    It turns out that the abstract data type used for representing entity
    profiles is one of the most practical consequences of choosing an entity
    resolution model over another.
    By knowing the abstract data type of the entity profile we empower the
    quality metric selection and application.
    
    Depending on the entity resolution model, we saw that we may have different
    data structures to take into account when running an entity resolution
    process: from lists of pairs to partitions over a set.
    Depending on the abstract data type we are encouraged to use certain quality
    evaluation metrics over others.
    In an effort to allow comprehensive qualitative evaluation, we have shown
    how we can switch from a matching model to a clustering model.
    Thus we have shown how to use both probabilistic and clustering metrics on
    the same data using the same ground truth.

    In an effort to make things more palpable, we have set up an experiment to
    show how we might look for insights that are invariant on the implementation
    choice and the data.
    The experiment is two-folded.
    On one hand, it is a step by step description of the calibration process of
    an entity resolution solution with the goal of deducing invariants.
    On the other hand, it confirms that the calibration process using the
    invariants is valid and successful on much larger and diverse data sets.
    
    One such invariant was that \textbf{probabilistic recall is always going to
    be distorted when the size of the entity resolution result is much greater
    than the size of the ground truth.}
    We have shown that cluster metrics such as pairwise recall and cluster
    recall provide a more realistic view to counteract this shortcoming of
    probabilistic recall.

    Another invariant is that \textbf{cluster precision is complementary to
    probabilistic and pairwise precision.}
    This leads to metrics that evaluate cluster shapes and sizes to form a
    harmonious complement to probabilistic metrics, pairwise metrics and to the
    Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) which is also pair-based.
    
    This leads us to our third invariant: \textbf{the Talburt-Wang Index and the
    cluster metrics on one side and the Adjusted Rand Index on the other usually
    agree only when there is a good balance between probabilistic precision and
    recall.}
    The configurations where these metrics agree on a control data set should be
    used on real datasets with some confidence.
    These configurations seem to be effective irrespective of the data we run
    entity resolution on, even if that data is purposefully designed to skew the
    results.

    % \section[future]{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

    From a theoretical perspective, the current paper covers only two entity
    resolution models.
    The findings can be transferred to studying other models and even other
    model families.
    Now that the link between the abstract data type used to represent an entity
    profile and the entity resolution model has been made, \textbf{we should be
    looking for more entity profile representations}.

    Existing models such as the one proposed by the Stanford Entity Resolution
    Framework\cite{Ben2009Swoosh} or graph theoretical
    models~\cite{veletsianos2009-enali,Kon19,Li2020} used frequently in entity
    alignment tasks are prime candidates for further exploration.
    On the other hand, the calibration process can prove inspirational in
    creating new automatically trained machine learning models for matching or
    clustering.

    From an experimental perspective, we can expand our experiment base using
    more and more algorithms to find out whether the conjectures outlined in
    the current paper are worth proving formally.
    The other aspect that is left unresolved is the claim that probabilistic
    recall provides a distorted interpretation over the entity resolution result
    when the result size is significantly larger than the ground truth.
    Albeit challenging, experiments to verify this claim can and should be
    designed since ML algorithms are trained and can presumably automatically
    improve this component.

    Lastly, another significant dimension of entity resolution refers to the
    quantitative measurement of performance.
    This also expands to entity resolution quality metrics.
    The existing findings~\cite{matchescu-er-metrics2023} can be augmented for
    other metrics and model families.
